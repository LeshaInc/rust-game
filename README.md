# A game made in Rust

Rendering roadmap:

- [ ] 3D pixelart-like rendering with edge detection
- [ ] Crisp shadows
- [ ] See through walls
- [ ] Custom post-processing (fog below and above the player plane)
- [ ] Planar reflections
- [ ] Water (with refraction and reflection)
- [ ] Fire (particle system rendered to a separate texture with post-processing)
- [ ] Skinning
